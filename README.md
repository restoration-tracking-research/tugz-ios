[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/foreskin_restoration/comments/pze7k7/interest_in_a_restoration_tracking_app/) [discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/foreskin_restoration/search?q=%22ATracker%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) [on the](https://www.reddit.com/r/foreskin_restoration/comments/kvbpjs/comprehensive_foreskin_restoration_support/) restoration subreddit the idea of a restoration-specific app has been brought up. Until now, there has not been one made for iOS.

**Suggestions for features:**

From https://www.reddit.com/r/foreskin_restoration/comments/pze7k7/interest_in_a_restoration_tracking_app/
- Anonymous, possibly decentralized for privacy
- Easy time tracking, reminders, and progress log for restoration activities
- Could also lead to a large-scale collection of restoration data, shedding light on what procedures are most effective
